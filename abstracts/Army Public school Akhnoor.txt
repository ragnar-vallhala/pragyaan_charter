From Equality to Equity: Reimagining Educational Infrastructure in Border and Remote Regions

Border and remote schools often do not conform to the principles underlying conventional
infrastructure regulations. Drawing upon the institutional experience of Army Public School
(APS) Akhnoor, a border-area school, this study argues that "same rules for all" can
inadvertently lead to unequal learning environments. Topography, inclement weather,
security constraints, inconsistent connectivity and protracted maintenance and supply
processes determine the practical, usable number of academic days. In this context, the
true assessment of infrastructure lies not in the adherence to the checklist parameters, but
in the campus's ability to operate safely and reliably, efficiently utilise instructional time and
guarantee that every student has consistent access to vital learning environs—classrooms
that remain operational throughout the year, facilities that are regularly maintained and
support systems that resiliently withstand local challenges.
The paper presents a pragmatic equity-oriented methodology that planners can implement
with minimal theoretical complexity. It professes to conduct a brief local assessment before
allocating funds—analysing seasonal disruptions, electricity stability, internet reliability,
technician/vendor accessibility and average repair turnaround time and to utilise this
information to prioritise investments. Foundational resilience can be built through functional
classrooms, reliable electricity with backup, operational water and sanitation, secure
storage and expedited maintenance procedures. It proposes hybrid models for digital
learning that remain functional during network outages, incorporating offline content and
physically hardened devices. It also underscores governance measures that operationalise
equality in border regions, including expedited clearances for urgent repairs, restricted
local procurement freedom for essential commodities and minor contingency reserves
associated with geographical vulnerabilities. The objective is to minimise instructional
disruption and ensure consistent learning conditions in high-constraint areas.
