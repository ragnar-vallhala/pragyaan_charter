Future skills and NEP 2020


    Abstract


    For schools situated in remote and far-flung districts such as Kupwara, the theme of Infrastructure & Equity assumes critical importance. Equity, in this context, goes beyond uniform distribution of resources and calls for need-based, context-sensitive support. Challenges related to geographical isolation, climatic conditions, limited digital connectivity, and constrained access to professional development directly impact learning outcomes. Strengthening physical infrastructure, digital access, teacher availability, and institutional support systems is essential to ensure that students in remote regions receive educational opportunities comparable to those in more accessible areas.


    With regard to Future Skills & NEP Implementation, the National Education Policy 2020 presents a progressive framework for transforming school education through skill-based, experiential, and learner-centred approaches. However, effective implementation in remote districts requires sustained capacity building, teacher training, digital infrastructure, and flexible curricular models. Students in Kupwara demonstrate resilience, adaptability, and strong community values, which can be channelled into future-ready competencies such as critical thinking, digital literacy, vocational skills, and ethical citizenship. Aligning national policy goals with regional realities will be key to ensuring that learners from far-flung areas are not only academically competent but also confident, innovative, and nationally competitive.
